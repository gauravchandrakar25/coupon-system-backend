## Introduction

Our project introduces a novel approach to discount coupons, leveraging the capabilities of Web3 technology. The backend serves as the foundation for our decentralized smart contract system, facilitating secure, transparent, and sustainable discount mechanisms.

## Features

- **Smart Contract Integration**: Seamless integration with Web3 smart contracts to issue, manage, and validate discount tokens.
- **Token Recycling System**: Implementing a unique feature allowing users to resend expired tokens, receiving a new token for use exclusively within the ecosystem.
- **Security**: Robust security measures to prevent fraud, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of each digital token.
- **Transparency**: Utilizing blockchain technology for transparent and immutable transactions, fostering trust between users and the brand.
- **Scalability**: Built with scalability in mind to accommodate future growth and increasing transaction volumes.
